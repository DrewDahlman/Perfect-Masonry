##Perfect Masonry
A way to detect missing gaps in a grid of elements and fill in those gaps to create a perfect fluid grid.

##Notes
This project is inteded to illustrate how to accomplish this not to be used as a plugin.

##TODO
On some screen sizes there appears to be a slight shift of 1 - 6px on filler elements, need to fix that.
